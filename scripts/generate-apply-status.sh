## How to Update This File

This file is semi-generated.

Preferred workflow:
1. Regenerate or review \`references/parity-matrix.json\`.
2. Run \`bash scripts/generate-apply-status.sh > references/per-tool-apply-status.md\`.
3. Run \`bash scripts/check-apply-status.sh\`.
4. Run \`bash scripts/status-summary.sh\` to confirm the summary reflects the same state.
