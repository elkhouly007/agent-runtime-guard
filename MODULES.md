# Modules

Agent Runtime Guard is a runtime decision spine and amplification surface. ECC (the upfront-contract model) is the enforcement foundation; agents, rules, skills, and the CLI form the amplification layer. For the longer-term direction, see [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md). For the module architecture and decision flow, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Phase 1 Capability Areas

| Capability | Path | Default | Policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Trusted external agents | `modules/phase1/trusted-agents.json` | allowed after payload review | Allowed when the harness is known and the outbound content has been reviewed. |
| Local MCP modules | `modules/phase1/mcp-policy.json` | allowed after review | Allowed when installed, reviewed, pinned, and documented. |
| External MCP modules | `modules/phase1/mcp-policy.json` | allowed after payload review | Allowed only with documented service/data flow and no sensitive outbound data without approval. |
| Shell execution | `modules/phase1/shell-policy.json` | mixed | Local safe classes may proceed; deletion, elevated use, sensitive overwrite, and similar high-risk classes require approval. |

## Phase 2 Capability Areas

| Capability | Path | Default | Policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plugins | `modules/phase2/plugins-policy.json` | classified | Local-only and reviewed external-read plugins may proceed after review; external-write and system-write plugins require approval. |
| Browser automation | `modules/phase2/browser-policy.json` | mixed | Read-oriented external browsing may proceed when the target and payload are clear; writes, uploads, purchases, and similar actions require approval. |
| Notifications | `modules/phase2/notifications-policy.json` | mixed | Local notifications are allowed; external notifications are allowed only when destination and content are low-risk and non-sensitive. |

## Phase 3 Capability Areas

| Capability | Path | Default | Policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Installers | `modules/phase3/installers-policy.json` | mixed | Project-local non-destructive setup may proceed; deletes, global mutation, downloads, and elevated steps require approval. |
| Wrappers | `modules/phase3/wrappers-policy.json` | mixed | Transparent wrappers may proceed; hidden sends, destructive behavior, and global changes require approval. |
| Long-lived helpers and daemons | `modules/phase3/daemons-policy.json` | mixed | Local stoppable helpers may proceed; persistent, elevated, or unclear external daemons require approval. |
| Integration templates | `modules/phase3/integration-templates.json` | template-only | Use templates instead of raw installs so file targets and risky defaults stay visible. |

## Reviewed Capability Packs

| Pack | Path | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MCP pack | `modules/mcp-pack/` | reviewed-only | Restores MCP capability through a reviewed registry, local/external notes, and an apply checklist. |

## Runtime Autonomy Layer (v1.0.0)

| Module | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime entry point | `runtime/index.js` | Re-exports all runtime module functions as a flat namespace. Required by hooks via `require("../../../runtime")`. |
| Decision engine | `runtime/decision-engine.js` | Core `decide(input)` function — scores risk, checks learned policy and auto-allow-once, applies trajectory nudge, returns action/explanation/workflow-route. `ECC_KILL_SWITCH=1` returns block immediately. |
| Intent classifier | `runtime/intent-classifier.js` | Maps shell commands to 8 intents (explore/build/deploy/modify/configure/cleanup/debug/unknown) using pure pattern matching. Zero I/O, zero deps. |
| Route resolver | `runtime/route-resolver.js` | Maps intents to routing lanes (direct/verification/review) via a static table with per-project override support. |
| Risk scorer | `runtime/risk-score.js` | Computes 0–10 risk score from command patterns, path sensitivity, payload class, branch, session risk, and trust posture. |
| Policy store | `runtime/policy-store.js` | Learned local allows, approval counts, pending suggestions, and auto-allow-once tokens. Persists to `~/.openclaw/agent-runtime-guard/learned-policy.json` (overridable via `ECC_STATE_DIR`). |
| Session context | `runtime/session-context.js` | Rolling per-session decision history (last 12 entries). Powers `getSessionRisk()` and `getSessionTrajectory()`. State file mode 0600. |
| Decision journal | `runtime/decision-journal.js` | Append-only JSONL audit log at `~/.openclaw/agent-runtime-guard/decision-journal.jsonl`. Mode 0600. Set `ECC_DECISION_JOURNAL=0` to disable writes (`ARG_DECISION_JOURNAL=0` is a deprecated alias). |
| Workflow router | `runtime/workflow-router.js` | Maps action → lane/surface/target/command for checks, review, setup, payload, wiring, escalation, and direct paths. |
| Action planner | `runtime/action-planner.js` | Builds structured action plans (commands, review types, modification hints) attached to each decision. |
| Promotion guidance | `runtime/promotion-guidance.js` | Lifecycle-aware guidance (new → approaching → eligible → promoted/dismissed) with concrete CLI hints. |
| Project policy | `runtime/project-policy.js` | Loads per-project `ecc.config.json` for trust posture, protected branches, sensitive path patterns, and project scope. |
| Context discovery | `runtime/context-discovery.js` | Auto-detects project root, git branch, primary stack, and config presence from filesystem. |

All runtime modules write only to `ECC_STATE_DIR` (or `~/.openclaw/agent-runtime-guard/`). No network access. No package manager invocations. State files are created with mode 0700 directories and 0600 files.

## Upstream Adoption Model

Use upstream as a reviewed feature feed, not as the trusted runtime base. Review `references/capability-log.md` and `references/parity-matrix.json` before adopting changes.

## Adding A Module

Add new modules as separate files or folders. Document each module's trust level, data flow, and approval trigger. If a module can call the network, run a package manager, write outside the project, or alter permissions, label it in `risk-register.md`, document the enable path, and tie it to the standing approval policy.
