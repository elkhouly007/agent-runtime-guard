## Current State Summary

Agent Runtime Guard currently includes:

- cross-tool policy layers for OpenClaw, OpenCode, and Claude Code;
- reviewed capability packs for MCP, wrappers, plugins, browser, notifications, and daemons;
- ARG amplification philosophy throughout: every agent, rule, and skill is purpose-built for this project;
- **49 specialist agents** following the ARG amplification philosophy — Mission, ARG-aware Activation, numbered Protocol, measurable Done When;
- **82 rule files** covering 12 language directories plus common, database, infrastructure, and web domains;
- **22 skills** for ARG debug, policy tuning, capability auditing, code analysis, orchestration design, and more;
- 20 approval-boundary scenarios and 14 prompt-injection scenarios;
- executable fixture coverage with **179/179 passing**;
- clean verification across audit, smoke, payload protection, fixtures, integration smoke, installation/profile checks, config/settings integration checks, apply-status validation, executable hygiene, setup-wizard edge cases, per-tool wiring-doc coverage, unified status-artifact checks, policy-lint, sensitive-data-detection, and superiority-evidence checks.

|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Agents | 0 | 49 | 49 | All written for ARG amplification philosophy |

## Sprint Status

### Closed parity-to-superiority program
- **Sprint 1, Truth and Verification**: complete
- **Sprint 2, Rules Parity Wave**: complete
- **Sprint 3, Skills Parity Wave**: complete
- **Sprint 4, Runtime Activation and Evidence**: complete

### Current follow-on runtime sprint
- **Sprint R2, Runtime autonomy follow-on / policy lifecycle auditability**: complete
- Delivered emphasis: adaptive action plans, explicit promotion flows, reviewed-default lifecycle visibility, lifecycle timing, and audit-friendly runtime history
- **Sprint R3, Routing and workflow fidelity**: CLOSED
- Sprint R3 delivered: `payloadClass` and `sessionRisk` flow through the hook path at full fidelity; `escalate` action has a dedicated human-gated workflow lane; one-time opt-in auto-allow (eligible-gated, single-use); session-trajectory-driven routing nudges actions up after repeated escalations (threshold/window env-tunable); `ECC_KILL_SWITCH=1` emergency block.

## Runtime Performance

Measured with `scripts/bench-runtime-decision.sh` (N=1000 representative decisions):

| Platform | Node | p50 | p95 | p99 | Ceiling |
|----------|------|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| win32 (Windows 11, Git Bash) | v25.5.0 | ~39ms | ~76ms | ~99ms | 500ms |
| ubuntu-latest (CI) | v20 (expected) | <1ms | <2ms | <5ms | 5ms |

Note: Windows numbers are dominated by `fs.appendFileSync` / `fs.writeFileSync` in the decision journal and session state recorder (~40ms per `decide()` call). Linux numbers are IO-bound only on first call due to module cache warmup.

## Honest Power Estimate

All content in Agent Runtime Guard is original — written specifically for the ARG amplification philosophy. There is no upstream comparison because this project has no upstream source.

- **Agents**: 49 original specialists; every file encodes Mission, Activation, Protocol, Amplification Techniques, and measurable Done-When criteria
- **Rules**: 82 original files; 12 language domains plus common/database/infra/web; YAML frontmatter with `last_reviewed` and `version_target` on every file
- **Skills**: 22 original skills spanning ARG configuration, analysis, orchestration, and amplification workflows
- **Runtime**: fully verified; bounded autonomous decision layer with kill-switch, learned-allow, auto-allow-once, session-trajectory nudge, payload classification, and JSONL audit trail

The correct current description is:

> **Agent Runtime Guard is a purpose-built, all-original agentic policy and amplification framework with a verified runtime decisioning layer, comprehensive rule coverage across 12 languages, and 179 passing integration fixtures.**

## v1.0.x Runtime Sprint Highlights

The runtime sprint (R1–R3, now closed) delivered:

1. runtime decisioning with local learned policy, session context, and project-aware config,
2. bounded workflow actions such as `require-review`, `require-tests`, and `modify`,
3. adaptive action plans based on repeated approvals and pending suggestions,
4. lifecycle-aware promotion guidance with explicit CLI next steps,
5. a dedicated `runtime promote` flow for reviewed local defaults,
6. promoted and dismissed default tracking with audit timestamps,
7. lifecycle timing output (`created-at`, `eligible-at`, accepted/dismissed, `last-approved-at`),
8. compact lifecycle summaries in `runtime explain`,
9. `ECC_KILL_SWITCH=1` emergency block; `auto-allow-once` single-use eligibility-gated grants; session-trajectory-driven routing nudges,
10. clean verification across `check-runtime-core.sh`, `check-runtime-cli.sh`, and the full `ecc-cli.sh check` path.
