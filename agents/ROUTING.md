# Agent Routing Guide

Quick reference for selecting the right agent. Full machine-readable index: `agents/index.json`.

## By Task

| Situation | Agent(s) |
|-----------|----------|
| Review a PR or code change | `code-reviewer`, then language-specific reviewer |
| Security vulnerability suspected | `security-reviewer` |
| Build or compile is failing | `build-error-resolver` → language-specific build resolver |
| Planning a new feature | `architect` + `planner` |
| Breaking down a large task | `chief-of-staff` |
| Code is too complex or hard to read | `code-simplifier`, `refactor-cleaner` |
| Writing tests / TDD | `tdd-guide` |
| E2E tests broken | `e2e-runner` |
| Performance is slow | `performance-optimizer` |
| Documentation out of sync | `doc-updater` |
| Exploring unfamiliar codebase | `code-explorer` |
| UI accessibility issues | `a11y-architect` |
| Healthcare / HIPAA compliance | `healthcare-reviewer` |
| ML / GAN / PyTorch work | `gan-planner` → `gan-generator` → `gan-evaluator` |
| Open source fork or packaging | `opensource-forker`, `opensource-packager` |
| Improving harness / agent config | `harness-optimizer` |

## By Language

| Language | Reviewer | Build Resolver |
|----------|----------|----------------|

| Go | `go-reviewer` | `go-build-resolver` |
| Java | `java-reviewer` | `java-build-resolver` |
| Kotlin / Android | `kotlin-reviewer` | `kotlin-build-resolver` |

| Database / SQL | `database-reviewer` | — |

## Escalation Chain

```
Task arrives
  └─ General?        →  code-reviewer
  └─ Security risk?  →  security-reviewer
  └─ Build broken?   →  build-error-resolver → language-specific
  └─ Complex plan?   →  architect → planner → chief-of-staff
  └─ Multi-agent?    →  chief-of-staff (coordinates all others)
```
